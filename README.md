# ICEBot
Discord bot mostly for fun that does simple things like roll dice and act as an 8ball.

Commands:
* !helix - Returns a random result for your prompt or question, based on the helix fossil (PRAISE)
* !roll - Rolls dice, accepts dice in the format of XdY. I.E. `!roll 4d6`
* !emoteme - Responds with a random emote from the current server
